bugs:
* rjd_slotmap: actually take salt into account when getting data

todo:
* rjd_cmd: no allocations and instead statically configurable
* rjd_slotmap: slot validation - add pointer to original slotmap in debug to avoid mixing slotmaps?
* rjd_fio: use rjd_result with constants for predefined results
* rjd_result: static assert for compile-time string
* rjd_mem: use virtual memory to protect against overwrites
* rjd.h: remove and use normal heirarchical #include structure?

util ideas:
* rjd_stream.h - unified interface for memory/file streams
* rjd_serialize.h - serializer interface with unified read/write
* rjd_bitset.h - interface for dense bool arrays
* rjd_filewatcher.h
* rjd_deque.h
* rjd_ringbuffer.h
