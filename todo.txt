todo:
* rjd_resource: register fallback resources for certain types
* rjd_resource: have the loader implement a reload notification interface and have rjd_resource_lib poll to perform reloads
* rjd.h: remove and use normal heirarchical #include structure?
* rjd_slotmap: slot validation - add pointer to original slotmap in debug to avoid mixing slotmaps?
* rjd_result: static assert for compile-time string
* rjd_stream.h: make rjd_ostream buffered as well
* test: unit test rjd_math and rjd_geo, adapting MS DirectX tests:
	* https://github.com/walbourn/directxmathtest
	* https://github.com/walbourn/directxtktest
	* https://aka.ms/atgsplcollision
* rjd_cmd: no allocations and instead statically configurable
* rjd_mem: use virtual memory to protect against overwrites
* rjd_mem: option to passthrough linear allocations to heap (can help debug corruption)
* rjd_binrw: swap on big-endianness

ideas:
* rjd_filewatcher: platform-generic utility for file change notifications
* rjd_schema: uniform interface for reading/writing structured data

low-priority ideas:
* rjd_bitset: interface for dense bool arrays
* rjd_deque: would be similar to rjd_array
* rjd_ringbuffer_view: state management for ringbuffers so you don't have to write it every time
