todo:
* make all strings UTF8
* rjd_cmd: no allocations and instead statically configurable
* rjd_slotmap: slot validation - add pointer to original slotmap in debug to avoid mixing slotmaps?
* rjd_result: static assert for compile-time string
* rjd_mem: use virtual memory to protect against overwrites
* rjd_mem: option to passthrough linear allocations to heap (can help debug corruption)
* rjd.h: remove and use normal heirarchical #include structure?
* rjd_path.h: make UTF8-compatible
* rjd_binrw.h: swap on big-endianness
* rjd_stream.h: make rjd_ostream buffered as well
* test: unit test rjd_math and rjd_geo, adapting MS DirectX tests:
	* https://github.com/walbourn/directxmathtest
	* https://github.com/walbourn/directxtktest
	* https://aka.ms/atgsplcollision

util ideas:
* rjd_filewatcher.h
* rjd_bitset.h - interface for dense bool arrays
* rjd_deque.h
* rjd_ringbuffer.h
